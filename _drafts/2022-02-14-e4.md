#### Exercise 4: Valentine's Day Card
Design and build a responsive Valentine's Day card. The "front" of the card will be on a screen size below 768px and the "inside" of the card will be on a screen size above 768px. This means you will need one media query. The content of the card should be Valentine's Day tangential.

##### Technical Requirements
* Front of card displays below 768px
* Inside of card displays above 768px
* Content is Valentine's Day tangential
* External CSS.
