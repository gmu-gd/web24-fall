#### Exercise 8: Landing Page
Create a landing page for a category from this year's Oscar nominations [List Here](https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2022). The page will be 1440px by 796px which means it will not scroll. The page should use a grid and any animation or interaction you want to include should be prototyped. There are multiple levels of typographic information here so focus on the hierarchy.

The contents of the page will be:
* The 94th Academy Awards
* Dolby Theatre at the Hollywood & Highland Center
* Sunday, March 27, 2022
* Category name
* Nominees from the category including all the information listed in the category (typically film and specific people but sometimes varies)
* Two buttons - One that says something like "vote now" and one that says something like "other categories"

##### Technical Requirements
* 1440px by 796px
* Uses a grid (columns)
* All content in above list included
* Does not use any branding elements (logos, colors, graphics) from the official Oscars website
* Hover states for buttons
