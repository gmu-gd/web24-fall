#### Exercise 6: Form Redesign
Redesign the [Mason COVID Health Check form](https://itsapps2.gmu.edu/symptom/Assessments). You can edit the content but  all the collected information must remain the same. This means you could break questions into multiple parts or add additional questions but you cannot delete questions. Questions could also be edited for clarity and/or length.

The redesign does not need to include the landing page or the submission page, just the form itself.

You are only designing the form, not coding it, and it should be designed in XD at 1440px wide. It can be on a single page or split up across multiple pages. Interactive features should be designed and prototyped.

##### Technical Requirements
* 1440px wide by however tall
* All the same information is collected
* States for form elements are designed and some are prototyped

<span class="due">Due Monday, {% assign seconds = 7 | times: 24 | times: 60 | times: 60 %}{{ page.date | date: "%s" | plus: seconds | date: "%B %d" }} by 4:30pm ET</span>
