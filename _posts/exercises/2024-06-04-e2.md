#### Exercise 2: Physical Grids
Use the three provided grids (PDFs on Blackboard) and create layouts on them physically or digitally.

* Physical Layouts – cut pieces from magazines, newspapers, packinging, etc. and glue them onto the page adhering to the grid. This means you will need to measure the space you want to fill and cut a piece out to fit that space.
* Digital Layouts – take screenshots of websites (text and images) and use those screenshots to place into the grid. The screenshots need to be cropped to fit precisely into the grid.

The grids should be strictly adhered to while creating your layouts and should keep in mind the hierarchy of the page.The layouts should be abstract and use images and text but they do not need to represent an actual layout with words and pictures. The grid does not need to be full and there should be open white space in your final layout.

##### Requirements
* three layouts using the three grids
* text and images on the layouts that adhere to the grid
* images added to figma
* images uploaded to blackboard
