#### Exercise 4: Found Letterforms
Create nine letters from something other than a standard mark making tool (so nothing with ink, paint, charcoal, other drawing tools, etc.). What you use to create the letters can be anything but should only be a single item, so don't make them out of sticks and flowers and leaves and dirt and glitter. The nine letters you need to create are A, B, G, K, S, M, Q, Y, Z and they should be consistent in method and form, meaning they should be create the same way and they should look like they go together. Think about stroke weight, contrast, scale, details, etc. The letters will need to be able to be cropped into a square so keep that in mind while creating them. Once you have each letter, nicely photograph or scan it and crop it into a 3" square. Take the nine 3" square crops and arrange them into a grid with no space between the images. 

##### Requirements
* 9 letters â€“ A, B, G, K, S, M, Q, Y, Z
