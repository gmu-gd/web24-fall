#### Exercise 6: manipulations
Take five of the printed words and phrases from the provided set and perform a radical physical or digital manipulation to each one. The content can inform the manipulation or the manipulation can inform the content. Each manipulation should be different from the last. Consider the following techniques:

* photographic distortion
* scanning
* motion capture
* folding
* vector alteration
* blur
* pixelation
* physical mirrors
* dirt
* glitch
* texturizing
* distressing
* collage
* soaking in liquid

Your aim throughout should be to force the type to become expressive. Your manipulations should be radical, but not arbitrary. Keep your manipulations abstract. Do not decorate your type with representational imagery, or transform your type itself into a representational image.

Scan or photograph each of your manipulations and print them out on letter sheets for review. Spend no longer than 20 minutes on each idea.

##### Requirements
* five, 8.5" x 11"  manipulations
* mix of physical and digital 
* images added to figma
* single pdf uploaded to blackboard
