#### Exercise 7: Recipe
Find a recipe online and design a one page print version of that recipe using only the type (no images). Select a recipe that is not overly complex and is relatively short. Design the recipe on a letter sized sheet of paper.

Create a grid and start designing. You are free to edit the content from the original source but all the information necessary to make the recipe needs to be present on the page. Use paragraph and character styles to make adjustments to the type easier. Remember to name them something that makes sense and someone else could understand.

##### Requirements
* full recipe on a single letter sheet
* uses a grid 
* image added to figma
* pdf uploaded to blackboard
