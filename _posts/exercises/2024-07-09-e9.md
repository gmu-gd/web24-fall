#### E9: Social Type
Design a 5 slide post for Instagram using the typeface and designer selected in class. The slides should introduce the typeface and the designer, give some context about the typeface (classification, when it was designed, what's it for, etc.) and designer (who were they, where were they from, etc.), and show some work that uses the typeface. The slides should go together as a set and use the same grid and styles on each one. The slides do not necessarily have to use the typeface you choose.
